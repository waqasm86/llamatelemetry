All notebooks support:
- Gemma 3 1B-12B (2048-dim embeddings)
- Llama 3.2 1B-3B, 3.1 8B (3072-4096-dim)
- Qwen 2.5 1.5B-7B (2048-dim)
- DeepSeek R1 distilled models
- Any GGUF model from llamatelemetry registry

### 3. **Quantization Focus**
Unlike transformers-explainer (FP32 only), these notebooks show:
- **Post-quantization behavior** (how Q4_K_M affects outputs)
- **Quality vs size trade-offs**
- **Precision loss visualization**
- **Production deployment decisions**

### 4. **Interactive Graphistry Dashboards**
Every notebook creates GPU-accelerated visualizations:
- Zoom, pan, filter in real-time
- Handle 1000+ nodes/edges efficiently
- Export visualizations for presentations
- Cloud-hosted, shareable URLs
